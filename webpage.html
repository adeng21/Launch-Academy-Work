				<p class="paragraph"> I am a laid-back, fun-loving 26 year old guy originally hailing from the Bay Area. I spent the first few years of my post-college life working in corporate america before moving to India to work for an international development NGO about 4 months ago. My experiences in India and personal interests have led me to become an <span>aspiring software developer!</span></p>

			<p class="title">Why am I interested in Launch Academy?</p>
				<p class="paragraph">One of the best recent trends is the explosion of free online education. There is so much great information out there now that you can basically teach yourself the basics of almost any field if you have the desire. Although I've been using <a href="www.codeacademy.com">some</a> of these <a href="www.udacity.com">resources</a> to teach myself the basics of programming, I believe attending a program like Launch Academy will greatly increase my learning curve. Also, I'm pretty sure I'll like it.</p>

			<p class="title">What will I bring to Launch Academy?</p>	
				<p class="paragraph">Enthusiasm. Grit. Can-do attitude.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">I am starting my journey to becoming a software developer from zero. While that is daunting, I find it incredibly exciting as well. Unlike traditional school where you don't necessarily have to put in all your effort and still come out with a degree, I realize that I'll only get as much out of Launch Academy as I am willing to put in. Knowing that motivates me to work as hard as I possibly can.

			<p class="title">Why it's a <strong>NO BRAINER</strong> to accept me as a student!</p>
				<p class="paragraph">If it wasn't obvious enough already, I am incredibly enthusiastic in starting this journey. I believe I have the intellect, the attitude and the motivation to be successful in this pursuit. Launch Academy will be very beneficial to my career but I also believe I can be very beneficial to Launch Academy later down the road as I enjoy giving back.</p>
